# Chitter Challenge

## Overview

This web app was built during Week 5 of Makers Academy. It is [deployed on Heroku](https://totoro-chitter.herokuapp.com).

Chitter is a public stream of 'peeps' -- short, 140-or-fewer-character-long messages broadcasted to the world. It may slightly resemble a popular social networking tool known as Twitter.

When using Chitter, a user can:

* Sign up, sign in, and sign out
* Post peeps to Chitter when logged in
* View all peeps in chronological order without logging in
